1. Layer Cake
Ingredients
* 2 and 1/2 cups (250g) sifted cake flour* (spoon & leveled)
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks; 170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 1 and 3/4 cups (350g) granulated sugar
* 5 large egg whites, at room temperature
* 1/2 cup (120g) sour cream, at room temperature*
* 1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract (yes, Tbsp!)
* 1 cup (240ml) whole milk, at room temperature*
Vanilla Frosting
* 1 and 1/4 cups (2.5 sticks; 287g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
* 5 cups (600g) confectioners’ sugar
* 1/3 cup (80ml) heavy cream
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract (or use clear imitation vanilla extract for stark white frosting)
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* sprinkles for garnish
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch cake pans.
Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.
Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until smooth and creamy – about 1 minute. Add the sugar and beat on high speed for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the egg whites. Beat on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk until combined. Do not overmix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.
Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24-25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.
Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy – about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cream, vanilla extract, and salt with the mixer running on low. Increase to high speed and beat for 3 full minutes. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin, more cream if frosting is too thick, or a pinch more of salt if frosting is way too sweet.
Assemble and frost: First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Decorate top of cake with sprinkles, if desired. Slice, serve, enjoy!
Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

2. https://tasty.co/recipe/macarons
Ingredients
for 30 macarons
MACARONS
* 1 ¾ cups powdered sugar
* 1 cup almond flour, finely ground
* 1 teaspoon salt, divided
* 3 egg whites, at room temperature
* ¼ cup granulated sugar
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 drops pink gel food coloring
VANILLA BUTTERCREAM
* 1 cup unsalted butter, 2 sticks, at room temperature
* 3 cups powdered sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 tablespoons heavy cream
Preparation
Make the macarons: In the bowl of a food processor, combine the powdered sugar, almond flour, and ½ teaspoon of salt, and process on low speed, until extra fine. Sift the almond flour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl.
In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites and the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the granulated sugar until fully incorporated. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form (you should be able to turn the bowl upside down without anything falling out).
Add the vanilla and beat until incorporated. Add the food coloring and beat until just combined.
Add about ⅓ of the sifted almond flour mixture at a time to the beaten egg whites and use a spatula to gently fold until combined. After the last addition of almond flour, continue to fold slowly until the batter falls into ribbons and you can make a figure 8 while holding the spatula up.
Transfer the macaron batter into a piping bag fitted with a round tip.
Place 4 dots of the batter in each corner of a rimmed baking sheet, and place a piece of parchment paper over it, using the batter to help adhere the parchment to the baking sheet.
Pipe the macarons onto the parchment paper in 1½-inch (3-cm) circles, spacing at least 1-inch (2-cm) apart.
Tap the baking sheet on a flat surface 5 times to release any air bubbles.
Let the macarons sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until dry to the touch.
Preheat the oven to 300˚F (150˚C).
Bake the macarons for 17 minutes, until the feet are well-risen and the macarons don’t stick to the parchment paper.
Transfer the macarons to a wire rack to cool completely before filling.
Make the buttercream: In a large bowl, add the butter and beat with a mixer for 1 minute until light and fluffy. Sift in the powdered sugar and beat until fully incorporated. Add the vanilla and beat to combine. Add the cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat to combine, until desired consistency is reached.
Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag fitted with a round tip.
Add a dollop of buttercream to one macaron shell. Top it with another macaron shell to create a sandwich. Repeat with remaining macaron shells and buttercream.
Place in an airtight container for 24 hours to “bloom”.


Brownies
Ingredients
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar*
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy
1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy
1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
3/4 teaspoons sea salt
2 large eggs
1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil**
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.
Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.
Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake for 42 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!

Vanilla Bean Scone
Ingredients
Scones:
2 whole vanilla beans
3/4 cups heavy cream
3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
2/3 cups granulated sugar
5 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 sticks (1/2 pound) unsalted butter, chilled
1 whole large egg
Glaze:
1 whole vanilla bean
1/2 cup whole milk, plus more if needed
5 cups powdered sugar, sifted, plus more if needed
Dash of salt
Directions
For the scones: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Split the vanilla beans in half lengthwise and scrape out all the vanilla "caviar" inside. Stir the caviar into the cream. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Sift together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the cold butter into pats, and then use a pastry cutter or two knives to cut the butter into the flour. Keep going until the mixture resembles crumbs.
Mix the vanilla cream with the egg, and then combine with the flour mixture. Stir gently with a fork just until it comes together.
Turn the dough onto a floured surface and lightly press it together until it forms a rough rectangle. (Mixture will be pretty crumbly.) Use a rolling pin to roll into a rectangle about 12-by-7 inches and 1/2-to-3/4-inches thick. Use your hands to help with the forming if necessary. Then cut the rectangle into 12 symmetrical squares/rectangles. Next, cut each square/rectangle in half diagonally, to form two triangles. Transfer to a parchment or baking-mat-lined cookie sheet and bake for 18 minutes, removing from the oven just before they start to turn golden. Allow to cool for 15 minutes on the cookie sheet, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.
For the glaze: Split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise and scrape out the caviar. Stir the caviar into the milk. Set aside for 15 minutes.
Mix the powdered sugar and salt with the vanilla milk, adding more powdered sugar or milk if necessary to get the right consistency. Stir or whisk until completely smooth.
One at a time, carefully dunk each cooled scone in the glaze, turning it over if necessary. Transfer to parchment paper or the cooling rack. Allow the glaze to set completely, about an hour. Scones will keep several days if glazed.

4. Lemon Bars
Ingredients
Shortbread Crust
* 1 cup (230g; 2 sticks) unsalted butter, melted
* 1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups + 2 Tablespoons (265g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
Lemon Filling
2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
6 Tablespoons (48g) all-purpose flour
6 large eggs
1 cup (240ml) lemon juice (about 4 lemons)
optional: confectioners’ sugar for dusting
Instructions
* Preheat the oven to 325°F (163°C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9×13 baking pan* with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.
* Make the crust: Mix the melted butter, sugar, vanilla extract, and salt together in a medium bowl. Add the flour and stir to completely combine. The dough will be thick. Press firmly into prepared pan, making sure the layer of crust is nice and even. Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned. Remove from the oven. Using a fork, poke holes all over the top of the warm crust (not all the way through the crust). A new step I swear by, this helps the filling stick and holds the crust in place. Set aside until step 4.
* Make the filling: Sift the sugar and flour together in a large bowl. Add the eggs and lemon juice and whisk until completely combined.
* Pour filling over warm crust. Bake the bars for 22-26 minutes or until the center is relatively set and no longer jiggles. (Give the pan a light tap with an oven mitt to test.) Remove bars from the oven and cool completely at room temperature. I usually cool them for about 2 hours at room temperature, then stick in the refrigerator for 1-2 more hours until pretty chilled. I recommend serving chilled.
* Once cool, lift the parchment paper out of the pan using the overhang on the sides. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and cut into squares before serving. For neat squares, wipe the knife clean between each cut. Cover and store leftover lemon bars in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
* Freezing Instructions: Lemon bars can be frozen for up to 3-4 months. Cut the cooled bars (without confectioners’ sugar topping) into squares, then place onto a baking sheet. Freeze for 1 hour. Individually wrap each bar in aluminum foil or plastic wrap and place into a large bag or freezer container to freeze. Thaw in the refrigerator, then dust with confectioners’ sugar before serving.


Coconut-strawberry ice cream pie
INGREDIENTS
1. Crust:
   * 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut
   * 6 oz. graham crackers
   * 1/2 cup virgin coconut oil
   * 3/4 tsp. kosher salt
   * Nonstick vegetable oil spray
2. Filling and assembly:
   * 2 pints coconut ice cream or gelato (not dairy-free)
   * 2 pints strawberry ice cream or gelato
   * 6 oz. strawberries, hulled, halved, quartered if large
   * 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
   * 1 Tbsp. sugar
PREPARATION
1. Crust:
   1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast coconut on a rimmed baking sheet until golden brown, 3–5 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes.
   2. Place graham crackers in a large resealable plastic bag, seal, and crush to fine crumbs with a rolling pin or heavy pot. Transfer to a medium bowl. Add toasted coconut, coconut oil, and salt and mix well. Mixture will look quite crumbly and dry at this point, but it will come together as it chills.
   3. Lightly coat a 9" pie dish with nonstick spray. Transfer graham cracker mixture to pie dish and press evenly and very firmly across bottom and up sides of dish with a flat-bottomed measuring cup (make sure crust extends all the way up to the lip of the dish). Chill until ready to fill (at least 20 minutes).
2. Filling and assembly:
   1. While the crust is chilling, remove coconut ice cream from containers (just peel away container if it’s paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic). Cut ice cream into 2" pieces and place in a medium bowl. Repeat with strawberry ice cream, placing in a separate medium bowl. Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir each, separately, with a large rubber spatula or wooden spoon until the consistency of thick cake batter. Transfer bowls to freezer and chill ice cream 10 minutes.
   2. Remove ice cream from freezer. Scrape strawberry ice cream into bowl with coconut ice cream. Fold together a couple of times with spatula until swirled. Don’t overmix; you want thick marbled ribbons. Chill in freezer 10 minutes.
   3. Scrape marbled ice cream into crust. Using a large spoon, create deep decorative swirls in ice cream (the strawberries will be poured into these divots later). Freeze until ice cream is very firm, at least 6 hours.
   4. Toss strawberries, lemon juice, and sugar in a medium bowl. Let sit at least 35 minutes and up to 1 hour.
   5. Remove pie from freezer and lower the bottom of the pie dish into a shallow bowl of warm water; hold it there 5 minutes (this will help slices release more easily). Spoon strawberries into divots; if you run out of places to contain them, reserve extras for serving.
   6. Running the blade of a chef’s knife under hot water and wiping dry before first cut and repeating as needed between cuts (this will give you neat sides), slice pie into wedges. Serve with any remaining strawberries alongside.
3. Do Ahead
   1. Pie (without berries) can be made 1 week ahead. Cover with plastic wrap once hardened and keep frozen.




Chocolate ice cream
INGREDIENTS
   * 7 ounces dark chocolate (70% to 75% cacao), finely chopped
   * 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons whole milk
   * 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
   * 6 large egg yolks
   * 13 tablespoons sugar, divided
   * 1/4 cup heavy whipping cream
PREPARATION
   1. Place chocolate in a medium metal bowl. Set bowl over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Stir chocolate until melted and smooth. Set melted chocolate aside; let cool slightly.
   2. Whisk milk and cocoa powder in a medium heavy saucepan over medium heat until mixture begins to boil; set aside.
   3. Using an electric mixer, beat egg yolks and 7 tablespoons of sugar in another medium bowl until very thick ribbons form, about 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, gradually add hot milk mixture to egg yolk mixture. Return mixture to saucepan. Add melted chocolate and whisk to blend. Stir over low heat until slightly thickened and an instant-read thermometer registers 175° about 5 minutes. Transfer chocolate custard to a large bowl and place over another large bowl of ice water. Stir until chocolate custard is cool.
   4. Bring remaining 6 tablespoons sugar and 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small heavy, deep saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring until sugar dissolves. Boil, occasionally swirling pan and brushing down sides with a wet pastry brush (do not stir), until a dark amber color forms, about 5 minutes. Gradually whisk in cream (mixture will bubble vigorously). Whisk caramel into chocolate custard. Strain into a large container; cover and chill for 2 days.
   5. Process custard in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to another container; freeze for 3 days before eating. DO AHEAD: Ice cream can be made 3 days ahead. Keep frozen.


Salted Pistachio Crumbles With Berries and Ice Cream
INGREDIENTS
   * ½ cup (60 g) raw pistachios
   * 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
   * ½ cup (100 g) sugar
   * ¼ cup (38 g) cornmeal
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
   * ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
   * 1½ lb. strawberries (about 1 quart), hulled, halved, quartered if large
   * 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
   * ½ tsp. ground cardamom
   * 3 Tbsp. honey
   * 2 pints ice cream of your choice
PREPARATION
   1. Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Spread out pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing halfway through, until slightly golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Let cool; pulse in a food processor until mostly finely ground but with some larger pieces remaining.
   2. Mix pistachios, flour, sugar, cornmeal, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl, then drizzle in butter and work in with your fingers or the handle of a wooden spoon until small pebble- to pea-size clumps form. Scatter crumble over a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, trying not to break it up too much, and bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Let cool.
   3. Meanwhile, toss strawberries, lemon juice, cardamom, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl to combine.
   4. Heat honey in a small skillet, stirring, until it begins to bubble and darkens slightly, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and scrape into strawberries. Toss, until honey is evenly distributed (it’ll be sticky in the beginning but will eventually dissolve). Let sit, tossing occasionally, until berries release their juices, about 15 minutes.
   5. Scoop ice cream into bowls. Spoon strawberries and their juices over; scatter crumble on top.




Frozen Margarita Pie
INGREDIENTS
   * 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter
   * 10 graham crackers
   * 3 Tbsp. sugar
   * 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided
   * 3/4 cup chilled heavy cream
   * 4 limes, halved
   * 1 (14-oz.) can sweetened condensed milk
   * 3 Tbsp. tequila blanco
PREPARATION

   3. Meanwhile, whisk cream in a medium bowl until stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes.
   4. Finely grate zest from 1 lime half into a small bowl; set aside. Squeeze juice from all of the limes into a fine-mesh sieve set over a glass measuring cup (you should have about 1/2 cup juice).
   5. Pour lime juice into another medium bowl. Add condensed milk, tequila, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt and whisk until mixture is smooth. Gently fold in half of the whipped cream just to combine, then add the remaining whipped cream and gently fold until no streaks remain (be careful not to overmix; you want to keep as much air in the whipped cream as possible).
   6. Remove pie dish from the freezer and scrape filling into crust. Use a spoon to gently spread filling evenly all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with reserved lime zest and freeze until filling is set, at least 8 hours.
   7. Do Ahead: Pie can be made 3 days ahead. Cover; keep chilled. Let soften in fridge 30 minutes before slicing.

   * ½ cup granulated sugar
   * 2 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted, slightly cooled
   * 1 tsp. vanilla extract
   * Vegetable oil (for frying; 6–8 cups)
   * Zest of ¼ lemon
   * 1 cup powdered sugar
   * Special Equipment: A deep-fry thermometer
PREPARATION
   1. Whisk baking powder, 2 cups flour, and 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine. Whisk egg yolks, yogurt, granulated sugar, butter, and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth. Add dry ingredients to egg mixture with a spoon or rubber spatula until dough comes together and is smooth with no spots of dry flour remaining.
   2. Turn out dough onto a well-floured large sheet of parchment or wax paper (you can be generous with the flour since you’ll brush off the excess later). Dust dough with more flour, place another large sheet of parchment or waxed paper over, and roll to ½" thick. Remove top sheet of parchment and brush off any excess flour with a dry pastry brush.
   3. Punch out circles with a 3½"-diameter biscuit or cookie cutter, glass, or mug. Punch out centers of rounds with a 1"-diamter cutter or plastic twist-off bottle cap (or poke a hole with a chopstick, then gently pull hole open to widen the center). Reroll any scraps and punch out additional doughnuts and holes.
   4. Fit a large pot with thermometer; pour in oil to come 1½" up the sides of the pot. Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°F. Fry doughnuts, turning halfway through, until puffy and a color somewhere between golden brown and mahogany, about 4 minutes total (time will be slightly less for doughnut holes). Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a wire rack and let cool 10 minutes.
   5. Meanwhile, whisk lemon zest, powdered sugar, a tiny pinch of salt, and ¼ cup water in a small bowl until a smooth glaze forms.
   6. Dip each side of doughnuts and holes into glaze, letting excess run off before returning to rack. Eat as soon as you can’t stand the suspense anymore.

Win Son Bakery's Red Date Cake
INGREDIENTS
1. Cake
   * 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more for pan
   * 6 oz. pitted dried red dates, coarsely chopped (about 2 cups)
   * ½ tsp. baking soda
   * 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour
   * 2 tsp. baking powder
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt
   * ¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar
   * ½ tsp. vanilla extract
   * 2 large eggs
2. Glaze and assembly
   * 4 whole pitted dried red dates
   * ¼ cup heavy cream
   * 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter
   * ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar
   * ½ tsp. kosher salt
PREPARATION
1. Special equipment
   1. A 9"-diameter springform pan
2. Cake
   1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Butter pan; set aside. Bring dates, baking soda, and ¾ cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until water is almost completely evaporated, about 3 minutes. Let cool.
   2. Sift flour into a medium bowl; mix in baking powder and salt. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat granulated sugar, vanilla, and remaining 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition; beat until mixture is very light and airy, about 3 minutes. Reduce mixer speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and beat just until incorporated. Mix in cooled date mixture, then add remaining dry ingredients and beat until just combined. Scrape batter into prepared pan and smooth surface to make an even layer.
   3. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 25–30 minutes.
3. Glaze and assembly
   1. While the cake bakes, make the glaze. Slice each date in half lengthwise, then thinly slice each half into strips. Place in a small bowl and pour in ½ cup boiling water to cover; let soak.
   2. Cook cream, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up sugar as needed, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes. Bring just to a simmer and cook, stirring, until glaze thickens slightly, about 5 minutes. Let cool until glaze thickens further but is still pourable, about 15 minutes.
   3. Remove cake from springform pan and slide onto a platter or large plate. Arrange drained date strips along edge of cake so they look like spokes on a wheel. Carefully drizzle warm glaze over cake, so it drips over the edges. Let cool completely before serving.


Salted Pistachio Crumbles With Berries and Ice Cream
INGREDIENTS
   * ½ cup (60 g) raw pistachios
   * 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
   * ½ cup (100 g) sugar
   * ¼ cup (38 g) cornmeal
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more
   * ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
   * 1½ lb. strawberries (about 1 quart), hulled, halved, quartered if large
   * 1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
   * ½ tsp. ground cardamom
   * 3 Tbsp. honey
   * 2 pints ice cream of your choice
PREPARATION
   1. Place a rack in upper third of oven; preheat to 350°F. Spread out pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing halfway through, until slightly golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Let cool; pulse in a food processor until mostly finely ground but with some larger pieces remaining.
   2. Mix pistachios, flour, sugar, cornmeal, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl, then drizzle in butter and work in with your fingers or the handle of a wooden spoon until small pebble- to pea-size clumps form. Scatter crumble over a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, trying not to break it up too much, and bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 20–25 minutes. Let cool.
   3. Meanwhile, toss strawberries, lemon juice, cardamom, and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl to combine.
   4. Heat honey in a small skillet, stirring, until it begins to bubble and darkens slightly, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and scrape into strawberries. Toss, until honey is evenly distributed (it’ll be sticky in the beginning but will eventually dissolve). Let sit, tossing occasionally, until berries release their juices, about 15 minutes.
   5. Scoop ice cream into bowls. Spoon strawberries and their juices over; scatter crumble on top.


Fruit Galette
INGREDIENTS
1. Crust:
   * 1 cup all-purpose flour
   * 1 tablespoon sugar
   * ½ teaspoon salt
   * 6 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes
   * 3 to 5 tablespoons ice water
2. Filling and assembly:
   * 3 cups sliced fruit (plums, peaches, apples) and/or fresh or frozen berries
   * 4 tablespoons sugar, plus more for dusting
   * Pinch salt
   * 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
PREPARATION
1. Prepare the crust:
   1. Stir together the flour, sugar, and salt, then add the cold butter and toss to combine. Use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour, pinching it between your thumbs and fingers until you’ve got a ragged mixture with irregular pieces of butter still intact, the largest about the size of an almond. Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the ice water over the mixture and use a fork to quickly incorporate. Keep adding water by the ½ tablespoon until it appears just moistened—a dough that’s too wet will lead to a tough crust, so err on the side of it seeming a little dry. Dump the mixture onto a piece of plastic wrap. Working from the outside of the plastic, shape it into a flat disc. Wrap, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.
   2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Prepare the filling:
   1. Using the same bowl as for the crust, combine the fruit, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, and the salt. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.
   2. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface and roll into a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Roll from the center, rotating 90 degrees after each roll, and adding a bit more flour as needed if the dough sticks. Drape the rolled dough over a rolling pin and transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the flour-sugar mixture evenly over the dough, leaving a clean rim of about an inch, and pile the fruit on top. Fold the crust around over the fruit, pleating rustically as you go. Brush the exposed pastry with water, then sprinkle generously—over the crust and the fruit, too—with sugar. Transfer to the oven and bake until the fruit juices are bubbling in the center and the crust is golden, 50 to 60 minutes, or more depending on the fruit.
   3. Serve warm, with fresh whipped cream or ice cream, or cold, perhaps for breakfast, with yogurt.


Trail Mix Cookies
INGREDIENTS
   * 1½ cups assorted raw nuts and seeds
   * ½ cup (60 g) old-fashioned oats
   * 1 large egg
   * 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
   * ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar
   * 2 Tbsp. (25 g) granulated sugar
   * 1½ tsp. vanilla extract
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt
   * ½ tsp. baking soda
   * ¾ cup assorted dried fruit (cut into ½" pieces if large)
   * ¾ cup chopped bittersweetchocolate bars or chips or disks
   * ½ cup (63 g) all-purpose flour
   * Flaky sea salt
PREPARATION
   1. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Toast nuts and seeds and oats on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl; let cool.
   2. Meanwhile, mix egg, butter, brown sugar, granulated sugar, vanilla, salt, and baking soda in a large bowl; let sit until nuts are cool (this will make for a chewier cookie).
   3. Add dried fruit and chocolate to nut mixture; toss to combine. Give egg mixture a good stir, then stir in flour. Mix in nut mixture, smashing it against the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until combined and mix-ins are evenly coated in dough. (It will look like too many mix-ins, but dough will come together as it chills.) Cover and chill at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.
   4. Reheat oven to 350°F. Using a ⅓-cup measure or #16 cookie scoop, portion out dough, packing firmly, to make 12 cookies. Divide between 2 parchment-lined baking sheets as you go. Using measuring cup or your hand, press cookies into 2½"-diameter disks about ¾" thick; sprinkle with sea salt.
   5. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back once, until golden brown and no longer wet-looking, 11–13 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.
   6. Do Ahead: Cookies can be made 1 week ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

23. Chocolatey Chocolate Cake
INGREDIENTS
   * 1 3/4 cups (225g) all-purpose flour
   * 1/2 cup (45g) unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
   * 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
   * 1/2 teaspoon salt
   * 1 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar

1. Optional toppings:
   * Confectioners' sugar, chocolate Swiss meringue buttercream, warm ganache, marshmallow icing, whipped cream
PREPARATION
   1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 10 by 3-inch round pan with butter, line the bottom and sides of the pan with parchment paper, and grease the paper. (I’ll let you just grease, line the bottom of the pan, and lightly flour the sides if you’re feeling lazy.)
   2. Place a large sifter or a sieve in a large mixing bowl. Add the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt and sift.
   3. Add the sugar and whisk until combined.
   4. In another large bowl, whisk the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla together.
   5. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and whisk until there are no lumps and the batter is smooth.
   6. Carefully pour in the boiling water and stir until combined. (Watch the little ones with the hot water!)
   7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the center of the oven for approximately 50 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, and the cake bounces back when lightly pressed.
   8. Remove from the oven and let the cake stand for 10 minutes. Run a butter knife around the cake to gently release. Peel off the parchment paper from the sides. Invert the cake, peel off the bottom piece of parchment, and cool on a wire rack.
1. Variation:
   1. Coffee Enhanced Chocolate Cake: Swap the cup of water for a cup of hot black coffee.
Tip
You can double this recipe when it’s party time—just use a 15 by 11-inch sheet pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes.


Easy One-Bowl Cherry Upside-Down Cake
INGREDIENTS
   * 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
   * 1 lemon
   * 2 (10-ounce) bags frozen sweet cherries or blueberries (no need to thaw)
   * 2 tablespoons plus 1 cup sugar; plus more for serving
   * 2 cups all-purpose flour
   * 2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
   * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
   * 3 large eggs, room temperature
   * 2 cups sour cream or whole plain yogurt, room temperature, divided
1. Special Equipment
   * 1 (9-inch) round cake pan with sides that measure at least 1 1/2-inches high
PREPARATION
   1. Arrange a rack in center of oven; preheat to 425°F. Take this time to assemble all your ingredients and do your prep. Melt 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter in small bowl in a microwave or in a small saucepan over medium heat and let cool. Finely grate zest of whole lemon, then squeeze 2 Tbsp. juice; set aside.
   2. Brush 1 Tbsp. melted butter around bottom and sides of cake pan (if you don’t have a pastry brush, use your fingertips). Line bottom of pan with a circle of parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles between parchment and pan. Making a parchment circle is easy: just place your pan on a piece of parchment, trace the circumference with a pencil, then cut it out.
   3. Toss cherries, 2 Tbsp. sugar, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 2 Tbsp. melted butter in cake pan (fruit will clump up when it hits the melted butter, which is fine). It’ll all melt together as it bakes.
   4. Bake cherries, gently shaking pan once halfway through, until fruit juices are thick and bubbling around sides of pan, 40–50 minutes. Let cool. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
   5. Whisk 2 cups flour, 2 tsp. baking powder, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 tsp. baking soda, and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl.
   6. Make a well in the center of dry ingredients. Beat 3 eggs to blend and pour into center of well along with 1 cup sour cream, 2 tsp. lemon zest, and remaining 5 Tbsp. melted butter (it’s okay if butter has re-solidified; go ahead and scrape it in there).
   7. Starting in the center, whisk to blend egg mixture, then make larger circles outward to incorporate dry ingredients. Whisk several more times until batter is smooth.
   8. Carefully dollop large spoonfuls of batter over fruit (it’s okay if pan is still warm and some fruit juices pool around batter); gently smooth surface.
   9. Bake cake until top is golden brown and a tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 45–55 minutes.
   10. Let cake cool in pan 10 minutes, then use a paring knife to loosen cake from edge of pan.
   11. Place a wire rack over pan, then swiftly invert rack and pan; cake should release from pan on its own. Lift cake pan off cake, peel off parchment, and marvel at your creation. If some of the cherries cling to the parchment, tuck them back into place. Let cake cool completely.
   12. Whisk remaining 1 cup sour cream with 1–2 Tbsp. sugar in a large bowl. Dollop on each slice before serving.

   * 6 Tbsp. unsalted butter or virgin coconut oil, melted, plus more for pan
   * 1½ cups (300 g) sugar, plus more for pan
   * 1 (13.5-oz.) can unsweetened coconut milk or 1⅔ cups half-and-half
   * 2 large eggs
   * 2 tsp. vanilla extract
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt
   * 2 cups (254 g) glutinous sweet rice flour, preferably Koda Farms Blue Star Mochiko

   * 1 tsp. ground spice of choice (such as cinnamon, cardamom, or turmeric)
   * 1 tsp. baking powder
   * ¼–⅓ cup unsweetened shredded coconut or sesame seeds
PREPARATION
   1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Generously butter a 9"-diameter cake pan or an 8x8" baking pan or 14 cups of two standard 12-cup muffin pans. (If you only have 1 muffin pan, you can bake the extra batter in a small loaf pan or mini muffin pan, or just discard it.) Generously coat pan with sugar, tapping out excess (about ¼ cup should do it).
   2. Place 1½ cups (300 g) sugar and 6 Tbsp. butter in a large bowl. If using coconut milk, heat in a small saucepan over medium, whisking constantly, until no clumps remain, then whisk into sugar mixture. If using half-and-half, whisk directly into sugar mixture. Add eggs, vanilla, and salt and whisk to combine.
   3. Whisk rice flour, powdered flavoring of choice (or 3 Tbsp. more rice flour), spice of choice, and baking powder in a medium bowl to combine, then whisk into egg mixture. Scrape batter into prepared pan and sprinkle with coconut or sesame seeds.
   4. Bake until top begins to crack and cake springs back when gently pressed, 55–65 minutes for cake and 45–55 minutes for cupcakes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 10 minutes. Run a knife around perimeter of cake, place a plate over pan, and invert cake onto plate. Hold wire rack over cake and invert cake onto rack (simply turn cupcakes out onto rack and turn over). Let cool completely.
   5. Do ahead: Cake can be baked 5 days ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

   1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Pour about 1 Tbsp. oil into a 9x5" loaf pan and coat bottom and sides with fingertips. Sprinkle granulated sugar onto sides and bottom of pan to lightly coat.
   2. Grate apples, peel and all, on the large holes of a box grater. Gather apples in a clean kitchen towel and wring out excess liquid. Be aggressive! You want them as dry as possible when they go into the batter.
   3. Whisk cinnamon, pepper, cardamom, and ginger in a medium bowl. Transfer 1/4 tsp. spice mixture to a small bowl; set aside. Add flour and baking powder to remaining spice mixture and whisk to combine.
   4. Whisk together eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, and 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl. Continue whisking vigorously until lightened in color and thickened. Whisking with one hand and pouring with the other, slowly stream 1 cup oil into egg mixture until combined. Gently fold flour mixture into whipped eggs with a flexible rubber spatula just until combined, taking care not to overmix.
   5. Fluff up grated apples and scatter over batter. Gently fold to incorporate.
   6. Transfer batter to prepared pan; smooth top. Add 2 tsp. granulated sugar to reserved spice mixture and mix to combine. Sprinkle spiced sugar evenly over top of batter.
   7. Bake cake until deep golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 60–70 minutes. Let cake cool in pan. Run a butter knife or offset spatula along edge of cake to loosen and invert onto a platter.
   8. Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead (the flavor gets slightly more intense each day). Store in an airtight container at room temperature.

Orange Chocolate Loaf Cake From Florida
INGREDIENTS
   * 1 1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
   * 2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 1/4 teaspoon salt
   * 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (preferably Dutch-process)
   * 1 cup sugar
   * 1 cup heavy cream
   * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
   * 2 large eggs
   * Finely grated zest of 1 large, deep-colored orange
1. For the glaze:
   * 1/3 cup orange juice
   * 3 tablespoons sugar
PREPARATION
   1. Adjust rack one-third up from the bottom of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees. You will need a loaf pan measuring about 8½ x 4½ x 2¾ inches, or one with about a 6‑cup capacity. Butter the pan and dust it all over lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs, shake out excess crumbs, and set the pan aside.
   2. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, cocoa, and sugar and set aside.
   3. Beat the cream and vanilla in the small bowl of an electric mixer until the cream holds a definite shape. On low speed, add the eggs, one at a time, scraping the bowl with a rubber spatula and beating only until the egg is incorporated after each addition. (The eggs will thin the cream slightly.)
   4. Transfer to the large bowl of the mixer and gradually, on low speed, add the sifted dry ingredients, scraping the bowl and beating only until smooth. Remove from the mixer and stir in the grated zest. That’s all there is to it.
   5. Turn the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for about 1 hour and 5 minutes, until the top springs back when lightly pressed with a fingertip.
1. For the glaze:
   1. As soon as the cake goes into the oven, mix the orange juice with the sugar and let it stand while the cake is baking.
   2. After you remove the cake from the oven, let it cool for 5 minutes. Then, a little at a time, brush the orange juice/sugar mixture all over the cake; encourage most of it to run down the sides between the cake and the pan, but thoroughly wet the top also. The cake will absorb it all.
   3. Let the cake stand in the pan until it is completely cool. Then cover the pan loosely with a piece of wax paper. Invert the cake into the palm of your hand—easy does it—remove the pan, cover the cake with a rack, and invert again, leaving the cake right side up.

Lemon-Pistachio Loaf
INGREDIENTS
   * ⅓ cup vegetable oil, plus more for pan
   * ¾ cup raw pistachios
   * Zest of 2 lemons
   * 1¾ cups all-purpose flour
   * 1 cup granulated sugar
   * 2 tsp. baking powder
   * ¾ tsp. kosher salt
   * 5 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
   * 7 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice, divided
   * 2 cups powdered sugar
PREPARATION
   1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 325°F. Grease a 9x5" loaf pan with vegetable oil, then line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Oil parchment paper (for insurance and an easy release).
   2. Pulse pistachios in a food processor until finely ground (it’s okay if some of the pieces are a bit larger). Set aside a heaping tablespoonful.
   3. Whisk lemon zest, flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, salt, and remaining pistachios in a large bowl. Whisk olive oil, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, remaining ⅓ cup vegetable oil, and ½ cup water in a small bowl to combine. Pour oil mixture into dry ingredients and fold with a rubber spatula to combine, being very careful not to overmix (this batter contains a high ratio of liquid, which means it can get gummy if overworked). Pour into prepared pan and tilt to distribute; batter should come halfway up the sides.
   4. Bake cake until golden brown all over, it springs back when gently pressed, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 50–60 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool completely in pan, at least 2 hours. Using parchment overhang, lift cake out of pan and place on rack. Peel away parchment.
   5. Whisk powdered sugar and 3 Tbsp. lemon juice in a medium bowl, drizzling in remaining 2 Tbsp. lemon juice as needed until you have a thick but pourable glaze. Pour glaze over cake, letting it drip down the sides. Immediately top cake with reserved pistachios, then let sit until glaze is set, at least 30 minutes.
   6. Do Ahead: Cake can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

Swirl Spice Cake
INGREDIENTS
   1. Streusel
   * 1 cup coarsely chopped pecans
   * ⅓ cup Savory-to-Sweet Coffee Spice Mix
   * 6 Tbsp. (75 g) light brown sugar
   * 3 Tbsp. (24 g) all-purpose flour
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt
   * 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
   2. Cake and Assembly
   * Nonstick cooking oil spray or room-temperature unsalted butter (for pan)
   * 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour
   * ½ tsp. baking powder
   * ¼ tsp. baking soda
   * ½ tsp. kosher salt, plus more
   * 1¼ cups (250 g) granulated sugar
   * ¾ cup (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
   * 3 large eggs, room temperature
   * ½ cup sour cream, room temperature
   * 2 tsp. vanilla extract
   * ¼ cup (28 g) powdered sugar
   * 1 tsp. (or more) orange juice
PREPARATION
   1. Streusel
   1. Whisk pecans, spice mixture, brown sugar, flour, and salt in a small bowl to combine. Drizzle in butter and mix until clumps form. Set aside.
   2. Cake and Assembly
   1. Preheat an oven to 325°F. Lightly coat an 8½x4½" loaf pan with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on long sides. Press paper into pan, then turn over, so greased side is facing up. Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, and ½ tsp. salt in a medium bowl to combine.
   2. Beat sugar and butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with paddle attachment on medium-high speed, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through, until very light and fluffy, 6–8 minutes. Reduce speed to medium. With motor running, add eggs one at a time, beating to incorporate and scraping down sides of bowl after each addition. Reduce speed to low; add half of dry ingredients and mix just to combine. Add sour cream and vanilla and beat to combine. Add remaining dry ingredients and beat until incorporated.
   3. Scrape half of batter into prepared pan. Top with streusel (yes, it will look like a lot, but use all of it!), then scrape remaining batter over. Starting at a short side of the pan and working your way to the other short side, drag a butter knife back and forth from one long side to the other through batter to marble streusel; smooth surface.
   4. Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 80–90 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan 15 minutes. Run a small knife around edges of cake to loosen if needed, then, using parchment paper, lift out of pan onto rack. Peel away parchment. Let cake cool completely.
   5. Combine powdered sugar and a pinch of salt in a small bowl, then mix in orange juice, adding up to a teaspoonful more if needed, until you have a thick but pourable icing. Drizzle over cake and let sit until icing is set before serving, about 15 minutes.
   6. Do ahead: Cake can be baked 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.


Whipped Cream Cake
INGREDIENTS
   * 2 1/4 cups cake flour or 2 cups all purpose flour, sifted (measured by sifting into the cup and leveling it off)
   * 2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 3/4 teaspoon salt
   * 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold
   * 3 large eggs, at room temperature
   * 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
   * 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons superfine sugar
   * Special Equipment: 1 (10-cup) fluted metal tube pan, coated with baking spray with flour
PREPARATION
   1. Preheat the Oven:
   1. Twenty minutes or more before baking, set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 375°F (350°F if using a dark pan).
   2. Mix the Dry Ingredients:
   1. In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt and then sift them together to make the mixture easier to incorporate.
   3. Mix the Liquid Ingredients:
   1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk beater, whip the cream, starting on low speed, gradually raising the speed to medium-high as it thickens, until stiff peaks form when the beater is raised.
   2. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and vanilla just until lightly combined.
   3. On medium-high speed, gradually beat the egg mixture into the whipped cream. The mixture will thicken into mayonnaise consistency (unless high-butterfat cream is used). Gradually beat in the sugar. It should take about 30 seconds to incorporate it.
   4. Make the Batter:
   1. Detach the bowl and whisk beater from the stand. Add half the flour mixture to the cream mixture and, with the whisk attachment stir and fold in the flour until most of it disappears. Add the rest of the flour mixture and continue folding and mixing until all traces of flour have disappeared. Using a silicone spatula or spoon, scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Run a small metal spatula or dull knife blade through the batter to prevent large air bubbles, avoiding the bottom of the pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small metal spatula.
   5. Bake the Cake:
   1. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, or until a wooden toothpick inserted between the tube and the side comes out completely clean and the cake springs back when pressed lightly in the center. The cake should start to shrink from the sides of the pan only after removal from the oven.
   6. Cool and Unmold the Cake:
   1. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes. With a small metal spatula, loosen the top edges of the cake and invert the cake onto a wire rack that has been coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray. Cool completely. The cake requires no adornment, but I love to serve it with a light dusting of powdered sugar or a large dollop of lightly sweetened Whipped Cream.
Notes
Do not chill the bowl and beaters for the heavy cream because the eggs will not emulsify as readily if the whipped cream is too cold. High-butterfat (40 percent) heavy cream produces a finer, more tender crumb. This cream is generally available only to bakeries and restaurants, but it is certainly worth asking your local baker to sell you a container.

East 62nd Street Lemon Cake
INGREDIENTS
   1. Cake:
   * 3 cups sifted unbleached all-purpose flour
   * 2 teaspoons baking powder
   * 1/2 teaspoon salt
   * 8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter
   * 2 cups sugar
   * 4 large eggs
   * 1 cup milk
   * Finely grated zest of 2 large lemons
   2. Glaze:
   * 1/3 cup lemon juice
   * 2/3 cup sugar
PREPARATION
   1. For the cake:
   1. Adjust an oven rack one-third up from the bottom of oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter a plain or fancy tube pan with an 11- to 12-cup capacity and dust it lightly with fine, dry bread crumbs.
   2. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt and set aside. In large bowl of electric mixer, beat the butter to soften it a bit. Add the sugar and beat for 2 to 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs individually, scraping the bowl as necessary with a rubber spatula to keep mixture smooth. On lowest speed, alternately add the dry ingredients in three additions and the milk in two additions, scraping the bowl with the rubber spatula as necessary and beating only until incorporated after each addition. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Stir in lemon zest. Turn the batter into prepared pan. Level top by rotating pan briskly back and forth.
   3. Bake for 1 hour and 5 to 10 minutes, until a cake tester comes out dry.
   4. Let cake stand in the pan for about 5 minutes and then cover with a rack and invert. Place over a large piece of aluminum foil or wax paper.
   2. For the glaze:
   1. The glaze should be used immediately after it is mixed: Stir the lemon juice and sugar together and brush all over the hot cake until absorbed.
   2. Let cake cool completely. Use two wide metal pancake turners or a cookie sheet to transfer it to a cake plate. Do not cut for at least several hours.
   3. Variations:
   1. I have made this with 1/2 cup Key lime juice in the glaze in place of the 1/3 cup lemon juice and it is divine. (But you should continue to use the lemon zest in the cake itself.)

Salty Buckwheat Chocolate Chunk Cookies
INGREDIENTS
   * ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 8 equal pieces
   * 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
   * ½ cup (63 g) buckwheat flour
   * ½ tsp. baking powder
   * ½ tsp. baking soda
   * 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt; plus more (optional)
   * ⅔ cup (packed; 133 g) light brown sugar
   * ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar
   * 1 large egg
   * 2 large egg yolks
   * 1 tsp. vanilla extract
   * 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate (65% - 75% cacao) bars or wafers (disks, pistoles, fèves), coarsely chopped
PREPARATION
   1. Heat butter in a small saucepan over the lowest heat possible until melted (you don’t want it to sputter or brown), about 5 minutes.
   2. Meanwhile, whisk both flours, baking powder, baking soda, and 1¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl.
   3. Scrape butter into a large bowl and add brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk vigorously until butter is absorbed into sugar, about 30 seconds. Add egg, then egg yolks, one at a time, whisking to combine after each addition; whisk in vanilla. Mixture should look much lighter in color and be almost creamy.
   4. Add dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir until just incorporated and almost no dry streaks remain. Set aside a handful of chocolate, then add remaining chocolate to batter. Gently mix just to evenly distribute. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel (a silicone lid or plastic wrap also works) and chill 2 hours.
   5. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a tablespoon, scoop out 2-Tbsp. portions of dough (or, if you have one, this is a leveled-off #30 cookie scoop or a heaping #40) and place 5 on each baking sheet, spacing evenly. Roll into balls and gently press 2–3 pieces of reserved chocolate onto the top of each one. It’s okay to jam the chocolate on there—some pieces can even be vertical. Cover and chill any remaining dough.
   6. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and front to back halfway through, until edges are golden brown and centers are puffed, 8–10 minutes.
   7. Working one at a time, pull baking sheets out of the oven and tap lightly on the stove to deflate cookies. Sprinkle with Diamond Crystal kosher salt (if you’re using Morton, skip it: the crystals are too large). Let cookies cool on baking sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks and let cool completely.
   8. Let baking sheets cool, then turn parchment paper over. Repeat process with remaining dough, dividing evenly between baking sheets, to make 6–8 more cookies.
   9. Do Ahead: Cookies can be baked 3 days ahead. Let cool; store airtight at room temperature.


Cinnamon-Date Sticky Buns
INGREDIENTS
   1. Dough:
   * ¾ cup buttermilk or plain whole-milk yogurt
   * 7 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
   * 1 large egg
   * ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar
   * 1 ¼-oz. envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)
   * 3 cups (375 g) all-purpose flour
   * ¼ tsp. baking soda
   * 1 tsp. kosher salt
   2. Filling and assembly:
   * 1 cup (packed; 180 g) Medjool dates, halved, pitted
   * 2 tsp. ground cinnamon
   * ½ tsp. kosher salt
   * 3 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided
   * ¼ cup (packed; 50 g) dark brown sugar
   * ¾ cup (83 g) powdered sugar
   * 3 Tbsp. buttermilk or plain whole-milk yogurt
   * 1 tsp. vanilla paste or extract
PREPARATION
   1. Dough:
   1. Combine buttermilk and 6 Tbsp. oil in a small microwave-safe bowl (it won’t get smooth and that’s okay) and heat in the microwave in three 10-second bursts until just about body temperature (it shouldn’t feel hot or cold to the touch); an instant-read thermometer will register about 98°F. (Alternatively, you can heat in a small saucepan over medium-low, stirring constantly, about 1 minute.)
   2. Whisk egg, brown sugar, and yeast in a liquid measuring cup to combine, then whisk into buttermilk mixture.
   3. Pulse flour, baking soda, and salt in a food processor to combine. With the motor running, stream in buttermilk mixture. Process until about 80% of the dough comes together into a ball (mixture will look very wet at first, then begin to pull away from the sides of processor), about 2 minutes.
   4. Using a bowl scraper or rubber spatula, scrape dough onto an unfloured surface. (It should still be pretty wet and sticky.) Knead, pushing it away from you, then pulling it back toward you, until a smooth ball forms, about 3 minutes. The dough will grow silkier, tighter, and easier to work with as you knead.
   5. Roll out dough into a rough 8" square. Fold dough over onto itself to make an 8x4" rectangle, then flatten it slightly and fold over once more to make a 4" square. Roll dough back out to an 8" square and repeat folding process (you should be back at a 4" square). Pour remaining 1 Tbsp. oil into a medium bowl and add dough (still folded); turn to coat. Cover bowl tightly and chill dough until doubled in volume, at least 8 hours and up to 1 day.
   2. Filling and assembly:
   1. Place dates in a small bowl and pour in 1½ cups hot water to cover. Let soak until softened, about 10 minutes.
   2. Drain dates and transfer to a food processor; discard soaking liquid. Add cinnamon, salt, and 2 Tbsp. oil. Purée, scraping down sides as needed, until smooth, about 4 minutes. (You should have about ½ cup purée.)
   3. Grease a 10" cast-iron skillet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil. Transfer dough to a clean, unfloured surface and roll out to an 8" square. Fold in half into an 8x4" rectangle, then fold rectangle over itself to form a 4" square (same folding process as you did before). If dough feels tough and uncooperative, let it sit about 5 minutes to relax and try again. Roll out dough to a 12" square about ¼" thick. Dollop date purée all over. Using a small offset spatula, spread evenly over dough, leaving a ½" border without purée along edge farthest from you. Sprinkle brown sugar over purée.
   4. Starting at edge closest to you, roll up dough into a tight log. Using a sharp serrated knife and long sawing motions, trim about ½" of dough from both ends and discard. Slice log crosswise into 3 sections, wiping knife clean between slices. Slice each section crosswise into 3 buns (you should have 9 buns total that are each about 1" thick). Transfer buns to prepared pan as you go.
   5. Cover pan tightly with foil (or a domed lid if you have one) and place in a warm, dry spot. Let buns rise until they’re doubled in volume and spring back when poked, leaving only a small indentation, 1–1½ hours, depending on how warm and humid your kitchen is.
   6. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Bake buns, still covered, until puffed, pale, and mostly set, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes if you prefer a soft and squishy bun and up to 25 minutes for a more toasted bun. Let cool slightly.
   7. Meanwhile, whisk powdered sugar, buttermilk, and vanilla in a medium bowl to combine.
   8. Brush glaze over warm buns and serve in skillet.
   9. Do Ahead: Purée can be made 3 days ahead. Place in an airtight container; cover and chill. Bring to room temperature before using.


Tahini Billionaire Bars
INGREDIENTS
   1. Shortbread:
   * Nonstick cooking oil spray or vegetable oil (for pan)
   * 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
   * ¾ cup (83 g) powdered sugar
   * ⅓ cup toasted sesame seeds
   * ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt
   * ½ cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into (½") pieces
   * 2 large egg yolks
   2. Butterscotch and assembly:
   * 1¼ cups (packed; 250 g) light brown sugar
   * ½ cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into 8 equal pieces
   * ¾ cup heavy cream
   * 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 tsp. Morton kosher salt
   * ½ cup tahini
   * 1 tsp. vanilla extract
   * 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate (65%–75% cacao), coarsely chopped
   * Toasted sesame seeds (for serving)
PREPARATION
   1. Shortbread:
   1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°F. Lightly coat a 9x9" or 8x8" baking pan, preferably metal, with nonstick spray. Line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Whisk flour, powdered sugar, sesame seeds, and salt in a medium bowl. Add butter and toss to coat. Using your hands, work in butter until pieces are about pea-size. Using a rubber spatula, mix in yolks. (Dough should hold together when squeezed.)
   2. Scrape dough into prepared pan and gently press into an even layer (lightly flour your hands if needed). Prick dough with a fork in several spots (this will help it stay flat as it bakes).
   3. Bake shortbread until golden brown, 24–28 minutes (or up to 35 minutes if using a glass dish). Let cool slightly.
   2. Butterscotch and assembly:
   1. While the shortbread is cooling, heat brown sugar and butter, whisking constantly, in a heavy medium saucepan over medium until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Whisk in cream and salt. Bring to a boil and cook, whisking constantly, until butterscotch is thick enough to coat a spoon (bubbling will become less frequent), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add tahini and vanilla and whisk until incorporated and smooth.
   2. Pour butterscotch over shortbread and tilt pan to distribute evenly. Chill until set, 30–40 minutes.
   3. Melt chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 40-second increments, stirring between bursts. (Alternatively, place chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water; bowl should not touch water. Heat, stirring often, until melted and smooth.) Pour over butterscotch and spread evenly to edges of pan; sprinkle with sesame seeds. Chill until chocolate is firm, 1–2 hours.
   4. Using parchment paper overhang, pull bars out of pan and set on a cutting board; remove parchment. Using a serrated knife, slice into 25–36 pieces (5–6 cuts in each direction). Bring to room temperature before serving.
   5. Do Ahead: Bars can be made 4 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.

   * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
   * 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
   * 2 large eggs
   * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

   2. Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the sugar and butter on medium speed in a large bowl.
   3. Slowly add in eggs, one at a time, and mix on medium speed until combined.
   4. Reduce speed to low and add vanilla extract, milk, and sour cream.
   5. In a separate bowl, combine both flours, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Slowly add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.
   6. Using a large spoon, fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
   2. Cinnamon Apple Filling:
   1. In a small saucepan over low heat, combine diced apple with sugar and cinnamon.

Red Velvet Cake
INGREDIENTS
   1. Cake:
   * 2½ cups cake flour
   * ½ teaspoon baking soda
   * 2 large eggs, at room temperature
   * 1½ cups sugar
   * 1½ cups vegetable oil
   * 2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar
   * 1 cup buttermilk
   * 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
   * 3 tablespoons red food coloring (from two 1-ounce bottles)
   2. Icing:
   * 1 (1-pound) box confectioners’ sugar, sifted
   * 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, softened
   * 1 stick (8 tablespoons) butter, softened
   * 1 cup chopped pecans
PREPARATION
   1. To make the cake: Set the oven to 350°F and adjust the rack positions to the middle and top third. Spray three 8-inch round cake pans well with baking spray.
   2. Sift the flour with the baking soda.
   3. In a large bowl, with an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, oil, and vinegar. On low speed, slowly add the flour and beat in well. Add the buttermilk slowly, then the vanilla, and then the food coloring.
   4. Pour the batter evenly into the pans and rap them on the countertop several times to eliminate any air bubbles. Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pans from shelf to shelf so they bake evenly and bake until the tops spring back when lightly touched, about 25 minutes altogether. Let the cakes cool in the pans on racks for 15 minutes.
   5. Run a knife around the sides of the pans and invert the cakes onto the racks to cool completely. Once they’re cool, refrigerate the cakes for 20 to 30 minutes to make icing them easier.
   6. To make the icing: Combine everything in a medium bowl and mix well until very smooth. It’s best to use the icing right away, when it’s soft and spreadable.
   7. Put one cake layer upside down on a cake plate or cake stand and cover the top evenly with frosting. Add a second layer, right side up, and spread with more frosting. Top with the third layer, right side up, and spread the frosting evenly around the sides of the cake and on top; check for any places where you can see through to the cake. Finally, sprinkle the pecans evenly all over the top of the cake.
   8. Once the frosting sets, cut into slices to serve. This cake keeps for up to 2 weeks in a cake keeper, but once it’s ready, people want to dive right in.
Two Tips
I sometimes like to mix the pecan bits right into the frosting. Don’t worry, they’ll stay crisp. You can make 18 cupcakes from this recipe. They’ll take about 25 minutes to bake.
